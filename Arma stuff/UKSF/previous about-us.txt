We take ourselves as a realistic unit, Very good at building breaching, stealth, and communication is improving dramatically. Do you have what it takes?? The Special Air Service (SAS) is the British Army's most renowned special forces unit. From the moment several black-clad figures appeared on the balconies of the Iranian Embassy in London in 1980, the Special Air Service became 'celebrities' both at home and oversees. Their motto, 'Who Dares Wins', has become part of British popular culture. Wearing this badge makes you proud of who you are and lets people know you are the best of all best, We hope to see some new faces very soon and thank you for reviewing.

Currently we are based in Takistan on the South Airfield. We have active troops on base when the server is available to join. However, like every unit, we have rules and regulations. They can be found under the website : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jhfDmxxbX7vLAi08hEoahit1uYSbyUrM

Please when you join make sure you are fully into milsim and you are willing to become a recruit and be trained to a good standard.
