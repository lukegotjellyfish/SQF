#about-us:

------------------------------------------------------------
We are a realistic milsim unit, focusing on building breaching and stealth; communication is improving dramatically. 

The Special Air Service (SAS) is the British Army's most renowned special forces unit, their motto: 'Who Dares Wins'. We hope to see some new faces very soon; thank you for reviewing.

Currently, we are based in Takistan on the Southern Airfield. We have active troops on base when the server is available to join. However, like every unit, we have rules and regulations found here: "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qd3PKRSLGYn-1p6t6YkP0XSvEOVwsoTpDzdxplNJeyQ"

Please, when you join make sure you are willing to become a recruit and be trained to a good milsim standard. Use discord on half a screen, it makes the important sections much easier to read.

How to join:

- Once an [OF/7]/[OF/6] has contacted you, you will be given your rank and asked to download the modpack: there is a guide to help you in #preset-teamspeak
+ Once you are finished installing the mods, your basic training starts
- From there, rank-ups and de-ranks are given at the end of operations if performance is worthy of one
+ If you are looking to be a pilot, you start pilot training which lasts usually a week or two depending on your effort and training outside of our training sessions
