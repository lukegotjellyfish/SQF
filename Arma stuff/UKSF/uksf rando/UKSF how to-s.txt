If you are experiencing crashes with TFAR on Teamspeak:
```ml
1. First try reinstalling the TFAR plugin: see the section above.

2. Delete the TeamSpeak folder named "TeamSpeak 3 Client" from "C:\Program Files".

3. Download TeamSpeak 3.1.10 from this link: "http://dl.4players.de/ts/releases/3.1.10/TeamSpeak3-Client-win64-3.1.10.exe".

4. If needed (I advise so), reinstall the TFAR plugin again (described above).
